# Pneumonia-Detection-From-Chest-X-Ray
This project culminates in a model that can classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia.

## This project consist of four steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Building and Training Your Model
3. Clinical Workflow Integration
4. FDA Preparation

## The goal of this project, upon it´s completion, is to be able to:

- recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
- perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
- establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
- extract images from a DICOM dataset
- train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
- translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
- plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval
